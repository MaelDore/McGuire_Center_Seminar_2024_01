**Title:**

Beyond Müller's mimicry model: Perceptual maps support continental-scale convergence in wing patterns of sympatric Neotropical butterflies

**Abstract:**

*In 1879, Fritz Müller formulated the first mathematical evolutionary model to explain the local convergence of warning signals in toxic butterflies found in Neotropical rainforests. Yet, to which extent the distribution of unpalatable species at continental scale is driven by mimetic interactions remains to be quantified. Furthermore, to tackle this question in an evolutionary perspective, the degree of similarity in the warning signals harbored by species in sympatry must account for the perception by predators of such patterns.* 

*I will present our results on the distribution of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and mimetic diversity of two flagship tribes of Neotropical butterflies, the Ithomiini (Nymphalidae: Danainae) and Heliconiini (Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae). In particular, I will address how we designed a Citizen Science project to describe perceived phenotypic variation in mimicry patterns, and tested for the unfolding to large spatial scales of Müller’s prediction for trait convergence between unpalatable species in sympatry.*
